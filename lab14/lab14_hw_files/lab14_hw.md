### 1. 
Clean up the column names (no capitals, not spaces) of `superhero_info`, then use 2 functions to remind yourself of structure of the `superhero_info` data set.


```r
superhero_info<-clean_names(superhero_info)
names(superhero_info)
```

```
##  [1] "name"       "gender"     "eye_color"  "race"       "hair_color"
##  [6] "height"     "publisher"  "skin_color" "alignment"  "weight"
```


```r

### 2.
Are bad guys bigger? Make box-plots of weight by `alignment` (alignment on the x-axis).

```r
superhero_info%>%
  na.exclude()%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=alignment,y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](lab14_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

### 3. 
Now, make a violin plot of weight by `alignment` (alignment on the x-axis). Add some color!
  What information can you observe in the violin plot that was not visible in the boxplot?

```r
superhero_info%>%
  filter(alignment!="NA",weight!="NA")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=alignment,y=weight,fill=alignment))+
  geom_violin(alpha=0.7)
```

![](lab14_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->
We can't see the shape of distriution of the data in boxplot. We can only see how many outliers there are but don't know its distribution from the mean.


### 4. 
Use `alpha = .5` in `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_violin()` to layer both plots on top of one another. What does this tell you about the distribution of weight in "`bad`" guys?

```r
superhero_info%>%
  filter(alignment!="NA",weight!="NA")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=alignment,y=weight,fill=alignment))+
  geom_violin(alpha=0.5)+
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5)
```

![](lab14_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->
The mean of bad guys' weight is at around 125, most of the bad guys' weight is under 250, only a few is above 250.

### 5. 
Box plots are great for showing how the distribution of a numeric variable (e.g. weight) varies among a categorical variable (e.g. alignment).
  Make your own violin plot with the superhero data. 
  What is your numeric data? 
  -height
  What is your categorical variable?
  -race


```r
superhero_info%>%
  filter(race!="NA",height!="NA")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=race,y=height,fill=race))+
  geom_violin(alpha=0.6)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```

### 6. 
Remind yourself what `beachbugs` looks like. Then generate a heatmap of buglevels by site and year. 
color it with `scale_fill_gradient(low="yellow", high="red")` or colors of your choice. you may find it looks best with one color!
(dont forget, `coord_flip()` is a quick way to improve the look of your plot if you dont like the default orientation)


```r
beachbugs_long
```

```
## # A tibble: 66 × 3
##     year site                    buglevels

### 7.  
Use the provided code to normalize the beachbug data set. 
Then make a heatmap with the `beachbugs_normalized` data, and use the same color chois as above. Which heatmap do you think is more informative? why?


```r
#makes a new column of the highest buglevel observed at each site
beachbugs_w_max <- beachbugs_long %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  mutate(max_buglevel = max(buglevels, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(site)
beachbugs_w_max
```

```
## # A tibble: 66 × 4
## # Groups:   site [11]
##     year site         buglevels max_buglevel

##  3  2015 Bondi Beach       14.3         32.2
##  4  2016 Bondi Beach       19.4         32.2
##  5  2017 Bondi Beach       13.2         32.2
##  6  2018 Bondi Beach       22.9         32.2
##  7  2013 Bronte Beach      26.8         61.3
##  8  2014 Bronte Beach      17.5         61.3
##  9  2015 Bronte Beach      23.6         61.3
## 10  2016 Bronte Beach      61.3         61.3
## # … with 56 more rows
```

```r
#makes a new table where the buglevels are normalized to the max_buglevel
beachbugs_normalized <- beachbugs_w_max %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  mutate(norm_buglevel = buglevels/max_buglevel) %>% 
  arrange(site,year) %>%
  select(site, year, norm_buglevel)   # you dont have to select(), but I think its a clearer looking table
beachbugs_normalized
```

```
## # A tibble: 66 × 3

```

![](lab14_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->
The second one, because it shows the max bug level at different years so we can better know which site has the worst bug issue at different years


### 8.
Let's make a venn diagram of `superhero_info`, from 4 questions:
Is their alignment evil? 
Are their eyes red?
Are they male?
Are they bald?

Start by making the 4 vectors, then the list of vectors. The vector for alignment is provided:
### super heros venn

```r
# evil

evil_vec <- superhero_info %>%
  filter(alignment == "bad")%>%
  pull(name)

# red eyes
red_eye_vec<-superhero_info%>%
  filter(eye_color=="red")%>%
  pull(name)

# male
male_vec<-superhero_info%>%
  filter(gender=="male")%>%
  pull(name)

# bald
bald_vec<-superhero_info%>%
  filter(hair_color=="bald")%>%
  pull(name)
```

Your list of vectors will look something like this:

```r
 questions_list <- list(evil_vec, red_eye_vec, male_vec, bald_vec)
```

### 9. 
Let's make the venn diagram! use the code from lab as a reference. 

```r
# something like:
 ggVennDiagram( questions_list, category.names = c("Bad", "Red Eye", "Male", "Bald"))
```

![](lab14_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->
Bad people that are red-eyed

### 10. Choose one intersection of the venn diagram that is interesting to you. Use dplyr to find the names of the superheros in that intersection. 


```r
superhero_info%>%
  filter(alignment=="bad"&eye_color=="red")%>%
  select(name)
```

```
## # A tibble: 23 × 1
##    name        
##    <chr>       
##  1 Amazo       
##  2 Apocalypse  
##  3 Black Abbott
##  4 Blackout    
##  5 Darkseid    
##  6 Demogoblin  
##  7 Doomsday    
##  8 Evilhawk    
##  9 Fixer       
## 10 Killer Croc 
## # … with 13 more rows
```



### 11. Make another venn diagram with the `superhero_info` data. What are your questions? ( At least 2!) 

```r
#are they good?

good_vec<-superhero_info%>%
  filter(alignment=="good")%>%
  pull(name)

#are they human?

human_vec<-superhero_info%>%
  filter(race=="human")%>%
  pull(name)

#do they have hair?

hair_vec<-superhero_info%>%
  filter(hair_color!="bald")%>%
  pull(name)
```


```r
q11_hero_list<-list(good_vec,human_vec,hair_vec)

ggVennDiagram(q11_hero_list,set_color=c("red","blue","brown"),category.names = c("Good","Human","Hair"))
```

### 12.
What are some very common super powers? Lets make a word cloud with the `superhero_powers` data.

Use the provided code to make the frequency table, then make a word cloud with it. 
Remember, you can change `scale_size_area(max_size = 20)` to a different number if the words wont fit!


```r
head(superhero_powers)

### 13.  
Who are some very powerful supers? 
 Lets make a different word cloud with the `superhero_powers` data. 
Use the provided code to make the frequency table, then make a word cloud with it.
You can use `hero_names` for the labels, and `sum_powers` for size. 


```r
power_quantity <- superhero_powers %>% 
  pivot_longer(-hero_names, names_to = "power", values_to = "yes_or_no") %>%
